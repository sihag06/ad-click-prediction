# ad-click-prediction
This project implements an ad-click prediction model using machine learning. It preprocesses ad data, applies feature engineering, balances classes with SMOTE, and evaluates multiple classifiers via F1 score to predict user clicks. Models include Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and AdaBoost for best accuracy.
